## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [Haxe](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-haxe-standard-framework/wiki) Demo: Stopwatch
This demo illustrates the use of the [StateMachine Utility](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-haxe-util-statemachine/wiki) to define and navigate the states of a Finite State Machine (FSM) of a working StopWatch.  Xinf is used to create the user interface.
